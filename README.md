# Word-Solver-TRIE
cross word solver using  Trie data structure in C++
This makes use of advanced data structures that utilizes potential of STRING MGMT and MANIPULATION using Trie data structure.
This is a simple implementation where the pre-defined words will be found if available from the crossword
Further the code can be improved by importing dataset for finding words from the randomly generated cross word solver
